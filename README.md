## Disclaimer ##

I am not taking any responsibility! Do not expect me constantly tracking the compability issues!

## File list ##

- `cmd.md`: Command lines / notes.
- `mujocopy.md`: **deprecated** Topics on installing and running `mujoco-py` on Windows / WSDL. Current version of mujoco (as in 2201) has been fixed the issue.

## For FCND drones (CS5491 asg1) ##

Create a new conda environment instead i.e. follow the [offical docuement](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning). Then follow `cmd.py` for additional libraries.
